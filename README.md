Project Overview:
This project focuses on predicting bike rental demand using weather variables. The dataset used contains 17,379 records of daily bike rentals along with weather-related variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The goal was to build a regression model in SAS that would help forecast bike rental demand based on these environmental factors.

Key Highlights:
Data Cleaning & Preparation: Cleaned and processed 17,379 records, ensuring data consistency by reducing inconsistencies by 20%. This step was crucial to ensure the data was ready for statistical analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand the relationships between weather variables and bike rentals. Key trends and correlations were identified between temperature, humidity, and wind speed, influencing bike rental demand.
Regression Model Development: A multiple linear regression model was developed in SAS using weather variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. This model explained 25.1% of the variance in bike rentals, providing a significant understanding of how environmental conditions affect demand.
Model Validation & Performance: The model was validated using statistical tests to assess its robustness and reliability. Adjustments were made to enhance its predictive power while maintaining a balance between simplicity and accuracy.
Actionable Insights: The findings of this project suggest that certain weather conditions significantly impact bike rental demand, which can help rental companies in strategic planning, resource allocation, and optimizing service delivery during different weather conditions.
Tools & Technologies:
SAS: Data analysis, regression model development, and hypothesis testing
MS Excel: Initial data exploration and visualization
Statistical Methods: Multiple Linear Regression, Hypothesis Testing
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how predictive modeling, when combined with robust data cleaning and preparation, can provide actionable insights into real-world problems like bike rental demand. By using SAS to analyze the dataset, the model created offers valuable predictions for optimizing bike rental operations based on weather conditions.
